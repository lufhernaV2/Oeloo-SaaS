// What does this application need to do?
/*
This application will be a place where professionals can link up, talk shop, organize outings and potentially collaborate.
The idea is to help others network and meet like minded individuals that have a common goal and need some help. 
This can be helpful for entrepreneurs, entry-level professionals and experienced pros that want to share their
knowledge with others. This is NOT only for tech or any white collar job, it is also for the blue collar workers that want to connect on projects.

1. Needs to have a solid landing page, that has all the information about the application and how it can help people connect
- Nav bar with About | Login | Pricing etc. (Maybe pricing can come at a later time?)
2. Authentication. Initially for the MVP a simple email address and password will be enough. Later though I want to add Oauth (Google, Facebook, etc.)
3. In the account dashboard you should be able to view different career groups and be able to view who are all in there, their events and potential jobs
based on their interests.
4. Must have a chat option along with forums and people able to make posts, add pictures, etc.
